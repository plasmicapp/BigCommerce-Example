# Plasmic BigCommerce components and example

This repo contains the Plasmic code components to let you integrate with BigCommerce store and build out any pages that go in a headless storefront.

## Getting started

- Clone the Plasmic project: https://studio.plasmic.app/projects/vn4GCfRoYe35APzZGsNDnF
- In the project, in the Project Settings left sidebar tab, replace the credentials with your own.
- Update `plasmic-init.ts` to point to your new project and API token (click the Code button in the Plasmic Studio toolbar to copy this).

See an example of commerce components in action (BigCommerce integration works identically): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OJ_gXmta2Q
